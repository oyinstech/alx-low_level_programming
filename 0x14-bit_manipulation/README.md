# C - Bit manipulation

## Tasks

## Header File
* main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## Tasks
### 0. binary_to_uint
* 0-binary_to_uint.c: C function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
  * where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
  * Return: the converted number

### 1. print_binary
* 1-print_binary.c: C function that prints the binary representation of a number
 * Not allowed to use arrays
 * Not allowed to use **malloc**
 * Not allowed to use the **% or / operators**

### 2. get_bit
* *2-get_bit.c*: C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
  * Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit

### 3. set_bit
* *3-set_bit.c*: C function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

### 4. clear_bit
* *4-clear_bit.c*: C function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

### 5.flip_bits
* *5-flip_bits.c*: C function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
